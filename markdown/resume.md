> Innovation and logic are the most important tools to solve a problem. Every problem has an optimal solution which best incorporates all factors. Every solution can be devised from components. And every component is another opportunity for innovation and logic.

## Recent Work Experience

2013-Present
:   **Senior Architect at Zipscene, NCR**

    Designed and led building of various large-scale data platforms and services:

    * Real-time, distributed, large-scale data warehousing software able to link and aggregate data across multiple dimensions in real time
    * Deep-learning-based consumer behavior modeling framework
    * Custom GIS platforms allowing real-time indexing and lookups of spatial-temporal data including national weather conditions and nation-wide events
    * Machine-learning automatic menu item tagging classifier
    * Developed custom cohort clustering algorithm for working with very large and wide datasets
    * Distributed locking coordination framework
    * Some public repositories including my architectures and sometimes my work are available at [https://github.com/zipscene](https://github.com/zipscene)
    * Some of the algorithms I developed were patented by the company, patent #9275125

    Zipscene's technology and team was acquired by NCR in 2018.

2017-2018
:   **Contract Data Developer at PatientPoint**

    Contract developer working to improve data infrastructure and reporting, with a focus on "big-data-scale" data ETLs and
    reporting. Worked primarily with Microsoft SQL Server, SSIS, SSRS, and Oracle SQL.

    (This was a temporary contract while working at Zipscene to bolster funding)

2012-2013
:   **Software Engineer at LaunchRock**

    Primarily worked as a full-stack developer on both the frontend (architect and JS programming) and backend (PHP) of the
    company platform. Also designed and implemented a flexible user management and tracking system built on top of Amazon's DynamoDB key-value store.

2011-2012
:   **Backend Architect at Giftiki**

    Designed, architected, and lead the building of a distributed backend platform for group financial transactions integrated with social media.


## Other Major Non-Work Projects

**Cluebot NG Machine Learning Wikipedia Anti-Vandalism Bot**

Cluebot NG is the English Wikipedia's primary antivandalism bot. It uses a combination of machine learning techniques including neural networks, Bayesian classification, and natural language processing to identify Wikipedia edits considered vandalism. The bot significantly outperformed all previous bots, has been running since 2010, and (as of 2018) has yet to be superseded. It is able to handle the full scale of English Wikipedia edits in real time.

I designed, architected, and wrote the machine-learning backend for this project.  Considering how much the machine learning landscape has changed in the decade+ since this was written, it's probably due for a revisit soon.

More information is available on the bot's Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot_NG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot_NG)

**ClueNet Distributed UNIX Network and Hobbyist Community**

Cluenet (now defunct) was an online community focused on educating today's youth about complex technical issues. It was in operation from 2005. I founded it and was the primary administrator for the entire network, which consisted of 30+ machines all over the world, connected together with unified authentication, shared resources, and a custom-written mesh VPN. It contained a great many custom projects and pieces of code to seamlessly hold the whole network together. Through this community, many people have tremendously expanded their knowledge about programming, networking, and even some more esoteric fields of knowledge, by communicating with and learning from one another.

I've also had quite a few other non-work-related projects over time, both large and small.  Some of them

## About Me & Skills

My main driver is the ability to innovate, solve unique problems, and build cool stuff. There are few feelings greater than that when a solution to a difficult problem works for the first time, or when a complex multi-component project has been completed and is functioning. This extends beyond computers; to my garage machine shop, little electronics lab, or basement wood shop; but the digital world, with all its potential for rapid innovation and exploration, has been my first and primary love.

I'm a huge proponent of using the right tool for a job.  With the variety of projects I've worked on, I've had the opportunity to play with a lot of different tools in different areas.  For older projects, I may be rusty on some of the specifics, but retaining a deep understanding of the underlying concepts makes it easy to reason about and pick back up a given technology when it becomes prudent.  My salient categories of experience are:

* High-level programming: Recent extensive experience with Node.JS, Python3.  Older experience with PHP, Lua, and others.  Favorite overall might be Befunge.
* Low-level programming: Mostly older experience writing optimized and UNIX network applications in C, C++.  Written plenty of assembly and C for AVR microcontrollers.  Had a job for a few years reverse-engineering x86 assembly.  A bit of JTAG ARM debugging and patching.
* Databases: Extensive work with both SQL (multiple dialects) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis, various key/value stores) databases.  Have designed data architectures encompassing relational, nonrelational, OLAP, OLTP, document-based scenarios.
* Systems (UNIX/Linux): Extensive experience with Linux systems.  Linux-user, command-line-lover, etc.  Some of my favorite tools are neovim and tmux, with a good command over commands.  Years ago set up and administered a world-wide hobbyist shell server network incorporating LDAP, Kerberos, network filesystems, and a custom-written mesh VPN.
* Machine Learning & Analysis: Have worked with multiple different machine-learning techologies starting in the 2000's with a homemade neural network library for captcha-breaking (for fun).  More recently have been working with some of the higher-level python-based data analysis and learning tools.
* Distributed systems: Developed scalable distributed systems in a few instances.  Have made use of various techniques and technologies for these including queueing, distributed locking, etc.
* Cloud and containerized systems: Have worked a fair amount with both AWS and GCP.  Played a bit with docker itself, but docker is on the docket for more extensive play-time.
